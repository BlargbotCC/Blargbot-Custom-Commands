# Greet Setup
For the best type of greeting, we recommend executing a seperate command within the greeting. So here we will first make the command to execute. Some of the greeting that we show here is what we use for BCC. It welcomes a user, but if you added a bot, it automatically assigns the bot role and does not greet them.

## **Step 1**: 
Enter the below code in the channel that you want for the greeting:
```
b!greet {execcc;greeting}
```

## **Step 2a**: 
We have two options below, if you are setting up a greeting without a verification system, or with a verification system. Use the **first** one if you **do not** have a verification system, use the **second** if you **do** have a verification system. You may enter this in any channel.

What this code does is gives a bot the role named `Bots`, or sends a welcome message in the channel set in **Step 1**.

## **Step 2b**: 
Coming soon, we still have to make it easier to use without IDs embedded in the code!

## **Step 3**: 
Congratulations! You now have an automatic join message, which can easily be edited to suit your needs!
